        <p class="about">Bryam Astudillo is a Graduate Research Assistant specializing in Structural Engineering at Stanford University. With a strong focus on seismic performance and nonlinear modeling of structures, Astudillo is passionate about Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Resilience. He has gained valuable experience in numerical simulation and full-scale testing, including shake-table testing of a 4-story building at the E-Defense shake table. Currently, his research centers on designing resilient structures using strongback frames and force-limiting connections. Astudillo's expertise, research contributions, and commitment to seismic resilience position him as a valuable contributor to the development of low-damage seismic resilient buildings. Beyond engineering, Bryam enjoys programming, playing soccer, and cherishes spending time with family and friends.</p>
